	<div>
	<ol> <a href="https://thehalalguys.com"> The Halal Guys</a></ol>
		<h4> Delish gyro's and the chicken was very good and balanced well with the crunchiness of the veggies topped off with a white sauce that brings warmth and juiciness followed by the red sauce which brings the heat. This is one of the best Halal places in the city!  Do yourself a favor and Run to this resturant!

<div>
	<ol> <a href=">https://omars.nyc</"/> Omarâ€™s Mediterranean East Midtown</ol>
		<h4> Omar's truly beats out all competition in the area in every category. When it comes to flavor/taste, they are the closest to real Middle Eastern food as it gets - the food is properly spiced and delicious. Price-wise, you can get two meals out of one of Omar's dish. When it comes to selection, there are so many sides to choose from. Embarrassingly enough, it's a heart-breaking selection each time (the babaganoush is so rich, but the potatoes are SO SOFT, but what about the tangy hummus!?) Can't give enough praise to this place.

<ol> <a href=">http://grayspapayanyc.com"/> Grays Papaya</ol>

	<h4> Who doesn't love All Beef Hot Dogs? The dogs are tasty and  and the driks are to die for!  You must try the Pina Colada, this is my all time favorite. I recommended for fast, delicious and cheap food.

	<ol> <a href="https://www.juniorscheesecake.com"/>Junior's Cheesecake</ol>



	<h4> They have so many options it was hard to choose.  Do I want to go with OG  plain NY cheesecake?  Maybe one with just some strawberries on top....Oooh they have carrot cake cheesecake.  Eventually I went with my heart and got red velvet cheesecake.  It was amazing.  So delicious.  Normally when on vacation I always want to try somewhere new.  Juniors is definitely a place I would visit again on future trips.

	<h4>This place is a true soul food BBQ spot. That's correct. I said soul food BBQ spot. Their is soul in this Q. No lie. The sides are a little more soulful than other spots. My favs are the Chicken Critters and Rattle Snake Bites.. Don't let the names scare you away.  It's good eatin'! You won't be disappointed. I promise.
